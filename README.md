# SwatchTime Clock

A simple Rainmeter Skin for displaying [Swatch Internet Time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time)

##Customization

By default, this skin comes with one terminal-style font. More can be used by dropping any .otf/.ttf into /SwatchTime/@Resources/Fonts, then opening SwatchTime.ini in your favorite text editor.

The font variables can be found in [MeterBeats], under the comment ";Font Customization."

Be sure to use the font's internal family name, NOT the file name. The Family name can be found simply by opening the otf/ttf.
